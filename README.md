# Maths with Maple

This repository contains material for a course that introduces Maple in
parallel with revising and extending the students knowledge of calculus.
There are some nonstandard choices of mathematical content and approach 
motivated by the availability of Maple.  Most of the content is in the
tutorial and lab problems and their solutions.

* Lecture slides: [screen version](lectures/all_lectures.pdf) and [print version](lectures/all_handouts.pdf)
* [Maple presentations](presentations)
* [Tutorial problems and solutions](tutorials/all_probs.pdf)
* [Maple primer](labs/primer.pdf)
* [Lab problems](labs/all_labs)
* Lab solutions: [Maple worksheets](lab_sols) and [PDF copies](lab_sols/pdf)
* [Exam questions and solutions](all_exams/all_exams.pdf)
